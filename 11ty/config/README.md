# Ideas on categories & url paths
Categories are a great top-level concept to organize content I want to use `tags` as a mechanism to show related items ala [Astro Doc's] bottom of the page links.

I also like [this type of category page](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). Might make sense since I want to add a `description` property to each category and possibly even an image/icon/logo (small). Actual pages will also have a link image similar to categories. Perhaps even a hero image but that might be overkill and I don't want to figure out that `CSS` within this template
