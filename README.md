# My code cheetsheet
I wanted something where I remember all the neat little code snippets I've created or find so I don't have to rewrite them in the future.

## Future
### Future Features & Enhancements
- Deployment to my domain using actions
- Optional Icon functionality set in `frontmatter`
- Fix favicon
- Change prefix to "`/cheatsheet`"
- Pagination on the category pages
- Cleanup code

### Future Plugins
These are plugins that I'm ineresting in playing with. Will not spend more than 2 hours on each to test them out. Unless, of course, they are priority such as a search plugins.
